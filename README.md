# Machine-Learning-Based-CyberDefenses-Malware-Detection-and-Evasion-Project
- Developed and evaluated multiple ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM, Random Forest) for malware detection using a PE header dataset (138K executables, 24 key features). Random Forest achieved the best performance with 95% TPR and 99% TNR after hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
- Implemented cross-validation, grid search, and SMOTE for model optimization and class imbalance correction, improving detection accuracy for both malware and rare goodware samples.
- Built automation scripts for feature extraction (using Python's lief library) and optimized model thresholds for improved accuracy, scoring 80/100 in black-box and white-box evaluations.
- Designed and executed adversarial attacks (XOR encoding, UPX packing, string appending) to bypass malware detection systems, achieving a 100/100 score in white-box evaluations by evading 100% of adversarial models.
- Overcame technical challenges in dropper creation using Visual Studio across multiple platforms (Windows VM, macOS) to automate malware sample generation and attack submission.
- Presented findings and demonstrated expertise in adversarial ML, malware detection, evasion techniques, and defensive strategies in cybersecurity.
